* Start filling in the `README.md` file
   * Write the title of your project and a short summary
   * This is a good chance to practice some basic Markdown
   * You'll eventually round out the `README.md` with more information
   

* Write a data dictionary for your data in the `README.md` file


* Start *framing* the problem -- This is Step 1 of the Data Science Workflow
   * Make a list of **what you know**
   * Make a list of **what you don't know**
   * Make a list of possible problem statements
      * Try to come up with *5-10* of them if possible
      * You will decide on which ones to explore later, but for now brainstorm as much as you can.
